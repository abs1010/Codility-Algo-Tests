/*
 An array A consisting of N different integers is given. The array contains integers in the range [1..(N + 1)], which means that exactly one element is missing.
 
 Your goal is to find that missing element.
 
 Write a function:
 
 class Solution { public int solution(int[] A); }
 that, given an array A, returns the value of the missing element.
 
 For example, given array A such that:
 
 A[0] = 2
 A[1] = 3
 A[2] = 1
 A[3] = 5
 the function should return 4, as it is the missing element.
 
 Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:
 
 N is an integer within the range [0..100,000];
 the elements of A are all distinct;
 each element of array A is an integer within the range [1..(N + 1)].
